ns-3 part :
- rename the stats variables in packet routing gym.cc and agent.py to be more descriptive(total and overlay)
- Rearrrange the code in packet routing gym.cc to be more readable
- Fix the problem of NN signalling where the agent considers the weights arrived if the last packet has arrived even though the other packets might be lost
- Add dynamically the NN size for big signalling in ns-3
- rewrite as the following :
    - signalling in separated files (signalling.py) calling files for big, small and ping signalling
    - have a module for receive pkt, send pkt and events like pkt lost, pkt arrived to dst, new pkt
    - have a module for the overlay node and underlay node
    - be able to draw the working tree of the ns-3 in a simple schema.
- The objective is to be able to provide easy access to the following :
    - the topology of the network (underlay and overlay)
    - the traffic matrix.
    - the control pkts settings (big, smalll, ping) and the ability to add new type
    - changing the behaviour of the nodes (underlay and overlay) in different situations (pkt lost, pkt arrived to destination, pkt arrived to hop, new pkt)
    - traffic generation (changing the generation process of the traffic, the type of the traffic ect...)

Python part :
- Fix the segIndex to be dynamic using nn_size.
- put extract info from info field as a function.
- Add the tensorboard logging in main.py and agent.py in the logger function
